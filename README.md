This is my first C# project, building a basic industry level REST API. 
The idea is to provide an online platform for posting and retrieving breakfast offers like UberEats does.
I am very grateful to Amichai Mantinband for his well-explained BuberBreakfast-Tutorial. In honour of his work, the naming has been left the same.
You can watch the tutorial and rebuild this project here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmDJIooZjBE&t=1819s
