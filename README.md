In this C# project I have built an industry level REST API with all 4 CRUD operations, Https redirection and Error handling. 
The idea is to provide an online platform for posting and retrieving breakfast offers like UberEats does.
I am very grateful to Amichai Mantinband for his well-explained BuberBreakfast-Tutorial. His license has been included as my alterations to his template are minimal.
You can watch the tutorial and rebuild it yourself here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmDJIooZjBE&t=1819s
