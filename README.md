#BuberBreakfast 

The idea is to provide an online platform for posting and retrieving breakfast offers like UberEats does.

##Technology

This C# project showcases an industry level REST-WebAPI with all 4 CRUD operations, Https redirection and Error handling. 
It is built in MVC architecture using the ASP.NET Core Framework and Mantinband's ErrorOr class for simplification of Error handling.
The development was done in Visual Studio Code which enables direct testing of the API via http requests (see video). 

##Presentation

A presentation of the functionalities, error handling and code structure can be viewed here:

##Further development

Further development steps could include an appealing frontend, establishing a database connection for external data storage and user account management with secure login etc.

I am very grateful to Amichai Mantinband for his well-explained BuberBreakfast-Tutorial by which I have built this. His license has been included, a few smaller changes to the codebase have been made.
