This is my first C# project, building an industry level REST API right away. The context is web development as you can see. 
I am very grateful to Amichai Mantinband for his well-explained BuberBreakfast-Tutorial. In honour of his work, the naming has been left the same.
You can watch the tutorial and rebuild this project here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmDJIooZjBE&t=1819s
